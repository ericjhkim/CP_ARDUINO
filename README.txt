This code is for a cart pole balancing robot that uses a 6DOF IMU (XL and GYRO), a motor controller, a wheel encoder, and an Arduino Nano.

As per Arduino convention, make sure the external libraries (unzipped folders) are in the Arduino libraries folder (default location should be in your Documents folder)

sensor_test is an environment to test the IMU sensors as well as the motors.
cp_ann uses an artificial neural network controller.
